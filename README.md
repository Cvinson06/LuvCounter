# LuvCounter
A Python OSC script counts a bool when it turns into True for VRChat

## To make it work:

1. Create a TXT file named "DATA" at the same folder as the script
  
2. Type in the parameters name you want to monitor at the first line
  
3. Type in a "0" or whatever the int number you want at the second line

- *this number will increase 1 after every time the bool you type in at the first line turns into True*
